Hello. During and after the Chinese Exclusion Act since about the mid-1880s, another group of immigrants had been filtering into America. This grew to a swell of immigration, the size of which the nation had never experienced. Uh-oh. Here's another political cartoon of the era. The caption says, Welcome to All. This cartoon reflects the welcome extended to non-Asian immigrants in the 1880s, and the concept of America as a land of refuge. As we know, this idea of ourselves as a land of refuge is a cherished myth. This era grew that myth for reasons that will become clear soon. I hope. The sign to the local Sam reads, Free Education, Free Land, Free Speech, Free Ballot, Free Lunch. The sign near the center of the image reads, No oppressive taxes, No expensive kings, No compulsory military service, No knouts or dungeons. So yay, come on in. Except for the thing about the Free Lunch, because we all know the old saying, Ain't no such thing as a Free Lunch.

As many of you probably know, the Statue of Liberty was erected in 1886. The new Colossus by Emma Lazarus was added in the early 1900s. This is the poem containing the famous words, Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses, yearning to breathe free. And the words, I lift my lamp beside the golden door. Emma Lazarus herself was born in America in 1849 from a large family of Sephardic Jews from Portugal and Spain who emigrated here before the American Revolution. The people who came in the 1880s through the 1920s from Southern and Eastern Europe have come to be called the classic immigrants. We'll be talking more about this label later. For now, let's understand the group. Who were they? Well, first they were poor, really, really poor. Hundreds of thousands of them were Jews who had resided in Southern and Eastern Europe for centuries. They were already hated in the countries where they lived and were ultimately pushed out by poverty and oppression. And in Russia, by raids on villages called pograms, soldiers would sweep through, grab all the men for the Russian army, burn the crops, and you could imagine what happened to the women. Some of this flow of millions of immigrants were from Southern Europe, especially Italy. Millions of the Italians were sojourners. They intended to make a little money and return home. Most Eastern Europeans, regardless of their religion or nationality, were forced out by abject poverty, oppression, and violence. Life simply became untenable. This is what sociologists call the push of immigration. The pull was the US, which had already developed a reputation for offering freedom and opportunity to newcomers. Based on the success of the Irish, and in spite of nativism and the Know-Nothings, the Irish had established themselves in the big cities as part of the infrastructure, firemen, policemen, politicians. Their success was a signal for all of Europe. You too can make a life here. Where did these poor immigrants go? Many stayed at the port where they landed. New York, Philadelphia, Boston. Many made their way to Chicago, Milwaukee, even Los Angeles. Most were forced into poor housing, tenements in New York, crowded conditions in Chicago or LA. Boyle Heights was the immigrant neighborhood in LA. If you were anything but white and Protestant in the early 20th century and you went to LA, you went to Boyle Heights. My ancestors moved there from Chicago, Philadelphia, and Boston in the early 1900s. Caesar Chavez Boulevard was originally called Brooklyn Avenue for the sake of all the immigrants who emigrated there from Brooklyn, New York as their original point of disembarkation. There's still a small street sign that's been retained. Brooklyn Avenue, of course, is tribute to where many of the Jewish immigrants first settled. The Breed Street shul, a Jewish synagogue, is on the National Register of Historic Places. It's being renovated now. It operated between 1915 and 1951 when an exodus of Jewish immigrants began to move to the west side of LA. These were children and grandchildren of the 1890s immigrants, more about these children and grandchildren later. These immigrants treated well in 1882 after the Chinese Exclusion Act, the other, there were other immigration restrictions that were enacted. One was a head tax on everyone entering a port from a ship, the Secretary of the Treasury was responsible for this. He, because it was a he at the time, was also responsible for customs. So people were treated very much like bundles of cloth and crates of goods. Another aspect of the 1882 law was what we refer to as the LPC clause. This said we had the right to refuse any criminal, lunatic, or person who could not take care of himself, that the public would have to take care of. Paupers, another name for poor people, were added in 1891. We will see how the clause was tweaked and strengthened, misapplied, in the subsequent decades. It's still an effect today. It's complicated and complex and born along with our original exclusionary legislation. Contract labor is another aspect of early immigration laws. What is that? Simply contract labor, usually foreign, is a labor force that is contracted to do a specific job. Contract labor also means that the worker is under an enforceable contract to do the work, very often for inferior pay, substandard living arrangements, etc. When the contract is over, the contractor sends or brings the worker's home. Sometimes.  Labor unions whose strength was growing in the late 1800s were against it. Of course they would be, don't contract out, higher union members already here. If you broke the law against contract labor, employers were fined, ship captains were fined, but there were many exceptions, often poorly defined. If you successfully emigrated here, you were still not out of the woods, if you became indigent within a year after arriving, you could be sent back. But if your country of origin would take you, where could you go? Many of these poor slipped through the cracks long enough to gain some kind of a financial foothold. In 1891, immigration transferred from local authorities to various federal government departments all within the executive branch. Our ever shifting stance on immigration is part of how the world sees us, the face we show. We'll talk more about this when we look at the period after World War II, but we have a ways to go yet. In 1892, Ellis Island was opened in New York. The largest number of ships from Europe docked here. It replaced Castle Garden, which was a place of desperation and with a reputation for ripping off immigrants. Here's a political cartoon of Castle Garden showing the pitfalls an immigrant can fall into. Throughout this period of mass immigration, New York City was the principal point of immigrant disembarkation. For 35 years, this was at Castle Garden on Manhattan. The prevalence there of various cheats and swindlers was one of the principal arguments for the development of Ellis Island. Ellis Island opened in 1892, coming to Ellis Island has become an embedded myth in many life stories. Daniels says Americans remember, in quotes, their ancestors coming through here. We'll talk about how and why in a little bit. Ideas about welcoming non-Asian immigrants began to change. Gradually, these poor southern and eastern European immigrants, including millions of Jews among them, came to be considered the wrong sort of people. They were accused of being only temporary. All of a sudden, sojourners were bad because they just wanted to take their money and go home. Sound familiar? In reality, most planned to stay here permanently because they had absolutely nothing and no place to go back to. So now, in addition to no Asians, the idea took hold that we should not have non-Anglos. Italians and Jews were not even considered white. Poles, Hungarians, and others from Eastern and Southern Europe were considered white, but not quite white enough. A new nativism arose. Natives were white, Protestant, and had northern European ancestry.

Of the fear of being turned away, Ellis Island and other East Coast ports of entry did not actually turn away a lot of people. This is because the job of screening was taken on by the steamship companies who transported these people. They didn't want people to be turned back at Ellis Island because then they would have to bear the cost of their passage back to Latvia or Estonia or Italy or wherever. So the European steamship companies were the real barriers for many years. There were various efforts to stop what was considered to be an overwhelming amount of immigration. In 1891, a discussion about giving a literacy test started. After 26 years of struggle and talk, it was finally passed into law. President Wilson, in spite of other prejudicial leanings, said that literacy tests were tests of opportunity, not of character, testing whether someone had the opportunity to learn to read and write, not whether they could. The immigration service, born out of ideas from the Chinese exclusion, got a new job description, keep people out. There was more and continuing pressure about contract labor. There was a new pressure to control our land borders. We were so focused on these undesirables from Europe that we totally forgot about our southern border where California and the entire southwest was beginning to grow. Railroads, agriculture, city construction, all consumed hundreds of thousands of workers. We don't like to think of ourselves as an empire like the European nations we issued during the American Revolution, but empire building did result with the acquisition of Hawaii and the results of the Spanish-American War where we acquired Puerto Rico, the Philippines, and other islands like Guam and the Marianas. We suddenly had possessions filled with non-white and non-black people. Acquisition of Hawaii involved thousands of Japanese and opened the door for more Japanese immigration. Uh-oh. This resulted in something called the Gentleman's Agreement. This said,among other things, Japan won't issue any more visas to go to the US, but wives and children can come in. This resulted in a phenomenon called picture brides where women were sent sight unseen to marry Japanese men already here. Well, they had seen a picture. Be sure to read about the causes of the Gentleman's Agreement thoroughly in Daniels. Like much of our legislation, it had consequences undreamtped of at the time. With World War I raging in Europe, we became hypernational. This is before we got into the war ourselves. In 1917, we passed another major immigration act, the first since 1882. It included a literacy test. President Wilson vetoed it but Congress overrode Wilson's veto. This speaks to the vehemence of the public about limiting immigration. Wilson had only been in office for a few months; for Congress to override a new president was kind of unheard of at the time. There were plenty of mitigating aspects of a literacy test. It didn't really keep very many people out. If the husband could read the wife, the mother, the grandmother, children, they didn't have to. Any recognized language was okay, not just English. It really wasn't very restrictive, but the message was clear. The door is closing. Think about the value that these kinds of vague messages have and what they do. If you or your family been fearful about things you see are here in the news, but don't fully understand. Yeah. The 1917 Act restricted Asians and South Asians. So everyone else in that huge container called Asia, besides the Chinese, was now excluded, except the Japanese who were still under the Gentleman's Agreement. The LPC clause was strengthened. It listed more mental health and political ideology reasons for exclusion. Potential retroactive expulsion was increased to five years. While actual deportations and expulsions were rare, the atmosphere signaled a change in attitude reflecting the passing of the 1917 Act. The open doorway got narrower. After the Great War, World War One, ended, (we called it the Great War because we didn't know there was going to be a two),  we saw what was called the First Red Scare. The focus was on Bolsheviks and Communism. Anti-Semitism grew. The Ku Klux Klan reimagined itself and now targeted Jews as well as Blacks and Catholics. In 1921, we passed another major immigration act. This act contains the first numerical cap limiting immigrants to 3% from the country listed on a 1910 census. 1910 and 11 were peak years of immigration during this period. The cartoon on the slide shows labor, a champion of poor workers, being aligned with Communism. Everything was going to lead to chaos. There's no date on the cartoon, but it must be pre-1920 because it's in the New York Evening Telegram, which was bought in 1920 and given a new name. In 1924, the Golden Door closed. The 1924 Immigration Act sealed its shut. The act was fueled by fear. Immigrants were taking jobs. They were lowering the standard of living, same old, same old. We know that the standard of living issue is also a current complaint, but a recent study of Cuban immigrants proved otherwise. We'll see more about that in coming weeks. The 1924 act represented a rejection of Europe and the horrors of World War I, our first mechanized war. Immigrants were seen as an assault on American values. They simply were not Protestant Anglo -Saxons. Modernity also had a role. The prohibition law of the 1920s, women's fashion showing their ankles, even their knees, changing times. Change causes anxiety and fear. Our instinct is to pull into our shells. But that never works because change happens. For the 1924 act, quotas were a tiny 2%, but based on the country of national origin as reported in the 1890 census. There was a much lower immigration from Europe in the years leading up to the 1890 census. So 2% of almost nothing is, well, you get it. The act excluded all people that were not eligible for citizenship. So all Asian, all Japanese, because we remember only whites and blacks could become citizens. There were no restrictions on the Western hemisphere because we recognized the need for agricultural workers. But Caribbean possessions were restricted by the quotas to their mother countries. And at the time, there were very few Caribbean islands who were actually free countries. Even without Western hemisphere restrictions, there were consequences. There were new border crossing fees, which of course affected the Mexican border. After centuries of open borders and the development of a regional culture that was neither Anglo nor Mexican, but something brand new, it now became difficult to be transnational. People simply settled here and raised families. These new Americans would suffer mightily in coming decades. On the good side, sort of, provisions for family reunification were made. And there was a commitment to study how best to plan for future restrictions. But the scientific view was based on the junk science of brain size, race, etc. So its results were false and unacceptable. Just as the Chinese Exclusion Act in 1882 had set us up for excluding people based on their ethnicity, the 1924 Act had long term effects on our concept of who should come in the door. From the 18th, early 19th centuries, race and nation were loosely conflated, race essentially meant much more than just physiognomy. It included what we would call ethnicity today with national borders thrown in. In the mid 19th century, the idea of "scientific races" evolved. That's science in quotes of course, because we now know there's no such thing. We talked about the survival of the fittest, etc., which we now know to be scientifically untrue, applying to humans. There's no genetic marker for race. There was also a Lamarckian component to our idea about race. What does that mean? Lamarck was an evolutionary thinker a few decades before Charles Darwin. He thought that your environment determined your physical traits. His example was that the giraffe evolved a long neck from generations of reaching up to the tops of trees to eat. This idea was that you could inherit whiteness from the environment. So European immigrants could eventually become white by changing their names, by losing their accents and doing what the white people did. Right. In the early 20th century, eugenics gained popularity. This train of thought said that physical appearance, intelligence, morality were all governed irrevocably by race. This is sometimes called biological determinism. Of course, it is totally false, but was embraced by many. It was and is part of the Ku Klux Klan ideology. Putting these ideas together, it allowed for old immigrants to redeem themselves while attacking new immigrants. For example, the early 1800s Irish versus the poor 1840s Irish versus the now established 1910s Irish. The old now wealthy 1840s Germans against poor 1910s Germans. There were ideas about reshaping race and nationality. Nationality differentiated Europeans and ordered them hierarchically. English and Scandinavians on top, Poles, Italians, and especially Jews at the bottom. But whiteness and Europeanness became a unifying principle which solidified exclusionary ideas about non-whites.

You've heard about politicians, presidents claiming to appoint people who look like America, Bill Clinton was among the first leaders to use that phrase in the appointment of his cabinet. In the early 20th century, we were attempting to understand what America should look like. The influencers of the day thought it should be white and northern European. With other broad exclusions, a division between Europe and the rest of the world was set up. People ineligible for citizenship were not discussed. So Chinese, Japanese, etc. were ignored. The Western hemisphere was not discussed, so central and South America became non-people if you were from those countries. There were few independent African countries included in the quotas because like the Caribbean, most were colonies of European countries and were subject to the quotas of the mother countries. So most of the world was excluded from the idea of national origins. They became non-people with no origin in our concept of immigration law. Even tighter controls on European immigration would have been put in place, except for a few problems that arose in the 1930s and early 1940s. There was a Great Depression, there was the Dust Bowl of the 1930s, then Hitler and the Nazis, and ultimately our involvement in World War II.

In 1893, Frederick Jackson gave a speech that seemed to explain American culture. He said essentially that the development of the American character was due to the expanse of undeveloped land, forget that there were Native Americans living there, and the constant migration of people west. He said that the farther people got from Europe, the more American they became. We liked this idea of the pioneers forging our individuality and independence on the frontier, even if it was a myth and not actually lived by the majority of the population. In the mid-1950s, Oscar Handlin turned our ideas of ourselves upside down. "The Uprooted" focused solely on the eastern and southern European immigrants that went to our large cities eventually established themselves and became white. Their seemingly overwhelming numbers for Handlin made it simple to forget every other group of people, every other kind of activity. His focus became the national idea. As we'll see, that idea is very hard to put to rest. By using the term uprooted, Handlin's premise was that these immigrants were poor, dispossessed, dazed, and ill -prepared to succeed in urban industrial America. Damaged goods. Later generations of historians challenged this idea. In reality, these immigrants were often savvy and industrious. It took ambition, drive, and a high tolerance for risk to transplant oneself, whether from the Irish countryside to Liverpool or from Minsk to Philadelphia. These were strivers whose children fought world wars and built great companies. I know you've heard this story dozens of times. It goes like this. My ancestors came here from fill- in-the-blank. They learned English. They worked hard. Blah, blah, blah. Why can't you? This group of immigrants based on Handlin's very influential ideas became the bar for later generations of immigrants. We'll see how that plays out. Handlin's influence was a look back. There were other examinations of the people and the period in the period. During these years of peak eastern and southern European immigration, there were artistic expressions of and by the immigrant population. Jacob Riis was a Danish American photojournalist and a champion of the poor. He documented life in the tenement slums of New York. He was an early adopter of flash photography. His most famous picture collection is in a book that is still being published today after well over 100 years. It's called "How the Other Half Lives". It was intended to expose the conditions in the immigrant neighborhoods and to a great extent it worked. Excuse me. Lewis Hine was a sociologist, a teacher and a photographer. He held classes for students at Ellis Island. His photos of children in the mills and the mines are often credited with changes in child labor laws. The Ashcan School of Art was a group of artists who painted dirty grubby tenement life. Hence their name. "The Melting Pot". We can't say enough about the impact of this play. It gave us our favorite metaphor. So untrue but so enduring. The idea and title of the melting pot of course came from the 1790s in a piece written by a French immigrant Hector St. Jean de Crevecoeur. He asked "who is this person melted into a new man?"  The American.

After World War II European Jewry was destroyed in the Holocaust. Americans saw their co-religionists annihilated in Nazi death camps. Europe was destroyed. There was no place to look to to call home. In addition to Oscar Handling's 1951 book, changing the point of view of millions of people including the children and grandchildren of the 1880s to 1924, Eastern and Southern European immigrants, books of the period were rediscovered after World War II. In the 1970s, we can't stress enough the impact of "Roots". A hugely popular book and TV event with many replications. Even though it was the story of a Black family tree traced back all the way through enslavement to Africa, "Roots" gave all of us the idea and reason for a turn toward finding roots. The book fueled the search for the past, not just for African Americans but for everyone, for the children and grandchildren, mostly grandchildren, of the early 20th century European immigrants. There was a yearning for a cultural past that could not be recovered. It just didn't exist. It had been erased. What do you do if you have no cultural past? You invent one. There's a saying: what the children want to forget, the grandchildren want to remember. So the grandchildren and the great grandchildren glorified their ancestors in many ways, resurrecting the imagined culture, finding the archives, restoring the buildings, creating the films. In films, we have "The Inheritance", a 1964 documentary. We have "Hester Street", a small movie, but it had a big following among the descendants of the classic immigrants, and Ellis Island restoration. When it opened in 1895, I'm sorry, 1995, immigration records were made available online and of course the site crashed. So the descendants of the southern and eastern European immigrants in the late 19th and early 20th centuries needed roots. These roots could not be found in Europe, so they were invented here.

That's it for this wonderful slide show. I know you're saying, oh gosh, thank goodness, it's over. The next one we're going to look at is going to be something quite different. So I'll see you then.

Flag question: Question 2
Question 27 pts
Public key cryptography tends to be slower than symmetric key cryptography. Therefore, public key cryptography is not well-suited for encrypting large data payloads (please keep this in mind throughout this assignment -- especially in the questions asking you do design a cryptographic scheme).
Do some research and explain why public key cryptography is less efficient.
Next, you will conduct an experiment where you will measure the amount of time it takes to encrypt the same file using symmetric and public key cryptography. To perform the encryption, you will be using two provided python scripts.
First, you will need to install the following two python libraries using python pip (sudo apt install python3-pip if you do not already have pip3 install).
sudo pip3 install pycryptodomex

sudo pip3 install progress

Attached are two Python scripts:
rsaenc.py
Links to an external site. -- A Python script that encrypts a file using the RSA public key encryption algorithm.  You can download a tested public key file here
Download here. To run the script, open up a terminal and run command python3 rsaenc.py <file to encrypt>. The argument represents the file to encrypt. For example, python3 rsaenc.py file.txt.  This will encrypt the file and  create a ciphertext file called rsa_encrypted_file.bin. You should use this public key
Download this public key. 

symenc.py
Links to an external site. A Python script that encrypts a file using the AES symmetric key encryption algorithm.
To run the script, open up a terminal and run command python3 symenc.py <file to encrypt>. The argument 
represents the file to encrypt. For example, python3 rsaenc.py file.txt. This will encrypt the file and
create a ciphertext file called aes_encrypted_file.bin.

Find a file between 10 -- 20 MB in size.  As an example, you can find a sample 20 MB video file hereLinks to an external site..
Use the Linux time command to time how long it takes to encrypt the above test file using public key cryptography.  For example, to time the encryption of very small file (file.txt) using python3 symenc.py, I can run it as:
junk-1.png
This will run the encryption script and will output the times.  "real" time is the value you are interested in.
Compare how long it takes to take to encrypt your 10--20 MB file you found above.  Please be sure to include screenshots of your results.  Please note, the encryption may take some time.  Please be patient.
What is your conclusion?  Use your results to describe why it is not recommended to use public key cryptography for bulk encryption (i.e., encrypting large amounts of data).  Similarly, please use your results to explain why symmetric key cryptography is a better fit for bulk encryption.  Do some research to explain the reason for the differences in timing.
Furthermore, is it true that public key cryptography is inherently more secure than symmetric?  You may need to do some research.

Flag question: Question 3
Question 35 pts
Clearly describe the elements of the symmetric cryptography system.
The HTTPs protocol is based on SSL/TLS security protocol (and many security applications use SSL/TLS). It uses symmetric key approaches to encrypt the session.  Do some research and clearly explain how SSL/TLS implements the necessary elements of the cryptographic system.

Flag question: Question 4
Question 45 pts
In class we have discussed the importance of developing data security solutions that are driven by the organization's data classification scheme.  Please also watch this videoLinks to an external site. (part of the Certified Information Privacy Professional/US (CIPP/US) certificate training)
Consider the CSUF Data Governance Guidelines Links to an external site.. The document also references the CSU Data Classification LevelsLinks to an external site..
1. Describe the criteria CSUF uses for classifying the data?
2. Pick data items from each of the classification levels.  Is it most critical to protect the confidentiality, integrity, or availability (i.e., CIA) aspects of this data?  What are the consequences if the identified CIA aspect is violated for that data?  Are there cryptography-based ITU-T X.800 services that you can implement to protect the CIA aspect you have identified?
3. Find another university's data classification scheme.  How does it compare to that of CSUF? How do they deploy cryptographic solutions to help protect data of different classifications?

Alice has a public/private key pair PUA/PRA, respectively
Bob and Alice also share symmetric key K1
Bob and Alice also share a MAC key K2
Let M represent a plaintext message
Let E(Key,  M) represent the encryption function that encrypts message M with some key Key
Let hc = H(M) represent the hash function where H computes a fixed-length digest of any message M

Let mc = MAC(Key, M) represent the MAC function where MAC computes a fixed-length digest of any message M using some key Key.

Alice wants to send message M to Bob while satisfying the following requirements:
M must be sent in plaintext, as the message is not confidential.
Data Integrity is required -- i.e., if the message was tempered with in transit, Bob must be able to detect it.
Computational resources are limited.  Therefore, efficiency is critical.
Almost forgot to mention! Bob has recently bragged about upgrading his cryptographic library. Alice can finally use MACs if appropriate.
Write a cryptographic equation showing how the message M should be processed by Alice.  Explain how your approach meets every requirement.

Question 126 pts
Consider communicators Bob and Alice.
Bob has a public/private key pair PUB/PRB, respectively
Alice has a public/private key pair PUA/PRA, respectively
Bob and Alice also share symmetric key K1
Bob and Alice also share a MAC key K2
Let M represent a plaintext message
Let E(Key,  M) represent the encryption function that encrypts message M with some key Key

Let mc = MAC(Key, M) represent the MAC function where MAC computes a fixed-length digest of any message M using some key Key.

Alice and her friend the Mad Hatter (MH for short) are advisors to the King of the Wonderland.  They study the Wonderland socioeconomic trends.  Just recently, they have completed an important study. Their rigorous study examines the potential impacts of deploying cryptographic technologies in the Wonderland society.  Their study report is contained in message M that they need to send to Bob, who is the first advisor to the King.
MH has public/private key pair PUMT/PRMT, respectively.  Also, MH does not share any symmetric or MAC keys with Bob or Alice. 
Although Alice and MH have worked on composing the message together, they agreed that Alice would be the one to send the message to Bob.  The requirements are as follows:
Confidentiality is required
Bob must be able to cryptographically verify that M was indeed composed by both Alice and MH and that M was not tempered with in transit (Cheshire cat has been running wild recently, the reports say...).
Computational resources are limited.  Therefore, efficiency is critical.
Write a cryptographic equation showing how the message M should be processed by Alice.  Explain how your approach meets every requirement.
 
Flag question: Question 13
Question 136 pts
Consider the previous question.  Bob has reviewed the study contained in message M.  He has found that the deployment of cryptographic technologies in the Wonderland, would have profoundly positive societal effects.
Bob now composes a new message M1 that advises the King to commit fully to ensuring a speedy implementation of cryptographic technologies in the Wonderland.
Bob plans bring his recommendation to the King of Wonderland on the USB drive (i.e., Bob does not need to worry confidentiality now, since he has physical control of the data while he walks to the King's castle).  The requirement is as follows:

The King wants Bob to to cryptographically link Bob's recommendation M1 to the rigorous study done by Alice and MT (again, the study is contained in original message M that Bob has received).  This is because His Majesty plans to publish Bob's recommendation together with the study in such a way so that any citizen of the Wonderland can cryptographically verify that: (1) Bob has indeed seen the study (to prove that his recommendation was based on research); and (2) The recommendation was indeed made by Bob.  The King also cautioned Bob to not modify the original study in any way (i.e., cannot modify the original message M).  Also, since Bob is a well known member of the King's cabinet, you may assume that all citizens of the Wonderland have access to his public key.  However, no citizen of the Wonderland shares any other cryptographic keys with Bob (they find him a bit too eccentric at times...).

Flag question: Question 16
Question 1612 pts
In class we have experimented with AES pycryptodome library.  Again, if you do not remember, you can install it by running the following commands in your terminal:
sudo apt install python3-pip
sudo pip3 install pycryptodomex
Attached is the file we have written that demonstrates basic encryption and decryption.  Please recall: AES is a block cipher that encrypts/decrypts in blocks of 128-bits (16 bytes).  It also accepts 128/192/256-bit keys.  In class we used a 128-bit key.
We have also written a simple TCP client Download clientand server Download serverprograms to get a clearer understanding of how the data is communicated.
Let's combine our skills to implement a simple and crude message transmission.  In the program, the client will take user's keyboard input, encrypt it, and send it to the server.  The server will receive the message, decrypt it, and print it out to the terminal.
Basically, we want to implement client/server programs that work as follows:
Requirement 1: Server and client shall be implemented in programs server.py and client.py. respectively.
Requirement 2: The server shall be launched from the terminal using command: python3 server.py <port number> <key>, where the <port number> is the port number and <key> is the 16-byte key.  For example, python3 server.py 1234 abcdefghnbfghasd.
Requirement 3: The server shall wait for a client to connect on the specified port.  Once the client has connected, the server will receive the message from the encrypted message from the client, decrypt it, and print the decrypted message.  After printing, the server shall go back to listen to more connections.
Requirement 4: The client shall be started using command python3 client.py <server IP> <server port> <key> where <server IP> is the IP of the server, <server port> the port on which the server is listening, and <key> is the 16-byte encryption key.  For example, python3 client.py 127.0.0.1 1234 abcdefghnbfghasd
Requirement 5: The server shall be started first in one of the terminals. 
Requirement 6: The client shall be started next in another terminal.
Requirement 7: The client shall prompt the user to type a message of arbitrary length.  Once the message is typed, the client shall encrypt the the message using the specified key, connect to the server on the specified IP and port (you may assume the IP is 127.0.0.1 -- the localhost), send the encrypted message, disconnect, and exit.
Hint: The message typed may or may not be a multiple of 16.  As you know, AES is a 16-byte block cipher, which means that it processes data in 16-byte blocks. You can use the pad and unpad functions provided by the pycryptodome library.
Example:
from Crypto.Util.Padding import pad
from Crypto.Util.Padding import unpad
plainTextBytes = b'abcde'
paddedPlainTextBytes = pad(plainTextBytes, 16)     # Pads the text to be a multiple of 16 bytes
print(paddedPlainTextBytes)                                      # See what the padded text looks like
                                                                                     # Prints b'abcde\x0b\x0b\x0b\x0b\x0b\x0b\x0b\x0b\x0b\x0b\x0b' where \0xb are the padding bytes
........
Now, when you decrypt the text, you can remove the padding by using the unpad function:
decryptedText = ....decrypt the text...
unpaddedText = unpad(decryptedText, 16)           # Remove the padding assuming 16-byte block cipher
print(unpaddedText)                                                # Will print the bytes of the original, unpadded text
Please upload your files below as a zip archive with a README file explaining how to run your program.

Flag question: Question 17
Question 176 pts
Use the AES Python code discussed in class in order to encrypt a multi-block plaintext.  Write the ciphertext bytes to the file.
Open your plaintext in the hexcurse (or any other hexeditor of choice if you have a preference).  You can check the installation instructions here. Links to an external site.The hexcurse usage instructions can be found hereLinks to an external site..
What is the byte representation of your plaintext?  Prove your answer with a screenshot.
Next, open up the the ciphertext file with hexcurse.  What is the byte representation of the ciphertext?   Prove your answer with a screenshot.
Next, use hexcurse to change the value of  one of the bytes of the ciphertext file.  Show the byte you changed in a screenshot.
Decrypt the ciphertext and save the decrypted text to another file.
Open the decrypted file hexcurse.  What do you observe.  Show the screenshot and explain what causes the phenomenon you observe.

Assignments
Programming and written assignments will be discussed in class and posted to the course website in advance
of their due dates. Each assignment description will include the assignment and grading rubric. Reading
assignments are posted on the course outline. It is the responsibility of the student to stay up to date with the
reading and to take the online quizzes for each chapter assigned.
Written assignments must be typeset and presented in a professional manner. Presentation, spelling and
grammar can be worth up to 30% of an assignment’s grade.
All programming assignments must be written in a pre-approved programming language, unless specified
otherwise. Coding style must conform to professional norms. At a minimum, code must be commented, have
descriptive names for identifiers, and contain a comment at the top of each file with pertinent information
such as the student’s name, email address, and assignment name. A plain text README.TXT must be
included with each assignment submission summarizing and documenting the work submitted. For students
unfamiliar with coding style, Google’s style guides are an excellent starting point,
« https://github.com/google/styleguide », particularly their C++ style guide,
« https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html ».
At the start of the semester, the instructor will detail the platform and tools used to grade student
assignments. It is the student’s responsibility to ensure that the assignments execute to his or her satisfaction
on the instructor’s grading platform.
There are approximately:
● 1 group project
● 12 weeks of reading assignments
Exceptions are made on a case by case basis given enough time and evidence to weigh the merits of
the application.
Late Assignments
Assignments turned in late will have the grade reduced 10% for each day after the assignment due date (up to
50%) unless approval for late work is given in advance. Late assignments and forms will be accepted up to
one week after the original due date. After a week, the grade will be entered as 0. If an assignment cannot be
accessed when I open it for grading, it will be marked late until I can open it (Google Docs – make sure all
links are “Anyone who has this link”)
Attendance Policy
This section of the class will not require mandatory attendance at either the lectures or the labs.
Note that labs have in-person exercises that are critical to your mastery of the concepts.
However -- this course will have a group project. Collaboration effectiveness (either online or in-person) will
be a component of your grade via this project. This project will be performed and assessed over the semester
so synchronous participation will be required. Teams are instructed to accommodate distancing requests by
team members, exactly as would occur in industry
